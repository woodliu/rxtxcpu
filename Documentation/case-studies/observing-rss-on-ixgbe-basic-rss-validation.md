# Observing RSS on ixgbe: Basic RSS Validation

This case study leverages commands which may be unsafe in your environment
(i.e. commands which change interface configuration, send packets with spoofed
source address, etc.). Be sure you understand the implications of, and have
taken suitable precations for, each command before running.

Setup details:
* `ixgbe0` is an `82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection (Ethernet
     Server Adapter X520-2)` using the in-tree ixgbe driver
* `eth0` is a nic in the same layer 2 network as `ixgbe0`
* `localhost` is the host which contains `ixgbe0`
* `remotehost` is the host which contains `eth0`
* `192.168.24.10/24` is the ipv4 address assigned to `ixgbe0`
* `192.168.24.11/24` is the ipv4 address assigned to `eth0`

We'll be using the traditional verification data provided by Microsoft (no,
this verification data is not specific to Windows).

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/verifying-the-rss-hash-calculation

In order to get the same hash values, we need to set the same hash key as is
provided in the verification document. Although this hash key is the standard
for verification, and is misused as a default in a great deal of code, the hash
key is properly secret data to prevent volumetric attacks against a single
queue. Saving and restoring the original hash key is suggested. In my case the
second interface of the X520-DA2 persists the original hash key.

The verification data doesn't include specifics for the final steps of RSS;
mapping a hash value to a queue via masking and an indirection table lookup.
However, you will need the same number of queues as I use to get the same
queue results. Let's use 16 queues.
```
[user@localhost:~]$ sudo ethtool -X ixgbe0 hkey 6d:5a:56:da:25:5b:0e:c2:41:67:25:3d:43:a3:8f:b0:d0:ca:2b:cb:ae:7b:30:b4:77:cb:2d:a3:80:30:f2:0c:6a:42:b7:3b:be:ac:01:fa

```

Now that we have RSS configured for verification, we need to use the
verification data to finish the mappings to specific queues.
[`rss.sh`](../../contrib/rss/) makes this trivial.
```
[user@localhost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss]$ ethtool -x ixgbe0 | ./rss.sh 66.9.149.187 2794 161.142.100.80 1766
hash:  51ccc178
idx:   120
queue: 8
[user@localhost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss]$ ethtool -x ixgbe0 | ./rss.sh 199.92.111.2 14230 65.69.140.83 4739
hash:  c626b0ea
idx:   106
queue: 10
[user@localhost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss]$ ethtool -x ixgbe0 | ./rss.sh 24.19.198.95 12898 12.22.207.184 38024
hash:  5c2b394a
idx:   74
queue: 10
[user@localhost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss]$ ethtool -x ixgbe0 | ./rss.sh 38.27.205.30 48228 209.142.163.6 2217
hash:  afc7327f
idx:   127
queue: 15
[user@localhost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss]$ ethtool -x ixgbe0 | ./rss.sh 153.39.163.191 44251 202.188.127.2 1303
hash:  10e828a2
idx:   34
queue: 2
```

We now know what results we expect; time to see what actually we get. Using
`rxqueue` we'll collect per-queue packet captures of `ixgbe0`.
```
[user@localhost:~]$ sudo rxqueue -w test.pcap ixgbe0
...
```

We'll leave `rxqueue` running on `localhost`.

On `remotehost` we'll use `hping3` to send tcp packets for each ipv4 tuple in
the verification data. We leverage routes so that these packets are given a mac
address and configure the routes to be via `ixgbe0`'s ipv4 address so that these
packets are given `ixgbe0`'s mac address (no need for promiscuous mode).
[`rss-validate-across-wire.sh`](../../contrib/rss-validate-across-wire/) can be used
for this or the following commands preceeded by `+` can be run manually.
```
[user@remotehost:~/rxtxcpu/contrib/rss-validate-across-wire]$ ./rss-validate-across-wire.sh eth0 192.168.24.10

```

Over on `localhost` we can now stop our `rxqueue` with Ctrl-C or similar.
```
[user@localhost:~]$ sudo rxqueue -pw test.pcap ixgbe0
^C
0 packets captured on queue 0.
0 packets captured on queue 1.
3 packets captured on queue 2.
0 packets captured on queue 3.
0 packets captured on queue 4.
0 packets captured on queue 5.
0 packets captured on queue 6.
0 packets captured on queue 7.
3 packets captured on queue 8.

0 packets captured on queue 12.
0 packets captured on queue 13.
0 packets captured on queue 14.
3 packets captured on queue 15.
15 packets captured total.
```

Using `tcpdump` we can see that the packets did in fact land on the queues we
expected. RSS has been observed.
```
